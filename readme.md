##Total Project Deliverable Summary

My focus areas are User Research Methods and Best Practices, User Interface Design Patterns for Successful Software, and Conducting Usability Testing. These areas are points of weakness for me especially at my job. I am the only UX/UI designer in my company located in Denver. We have a nationwide team and we meet once a week but I need to be responsible and take care to make sure that I am doing my job correctly and not cutting corners. I plan on focusing on areas of weakness throughout the semester taking 10 week courses through Interaction Design. 
At the end of the semester, I plan on creating a project that will encompass these areas of weakness that will showcase what Iâ€™ve learned not only in this class but through my time here at MCAD. The project will be simple and straightforward but will include UX/UI design strategies and elements.

Learning Goals
User Research Methods and Best Practices should speed up my response times in meetings. I should be able to clearly articulate effective questions and gather meaningful responses in requirements meetings.
UI Design Patterns should help me create quick interfaces that are effective, efficient, and beautiful. 
Usability Testing should help my understanding of the team I work with. Increased knowledge in a subject matter that I feel weak at should help me communicate and understand my coworkers.
